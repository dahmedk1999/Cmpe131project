# Python Folium/Leaflet.js Example

> Example showing how to generate a map with markers, custom markers, circle markers, vega visualizations, Geojson and choropleth maps

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies
pip install folium
pip install pandas

# Generate maps
python map.py
python map2.py
```
This is mostly HTML though and since we want to make an app, not a webpage. We have to integrate it into a program + UI
